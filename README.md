Let's enumerate some key features of this library:

- **Support for Various Sources** — It can read flat or nested configurations. Thanks to `IndexedFlat`.
- **Automatic Document Generation** — It can auto-generate documentation of configurations.
- **Automatic Derivation** — It has built-in support for automatic derivation of readers and writers for case classes and sealed traits.
- **Type-level Constraints and Automatic Validation** — because it supports _Refined_ types, we can write type-level predicates which constrain the set of values described for data types.
- **Descriptive Errors** — It accumulates all errors and reports all of them to the user rather than failing fast.
- **Integrations** — Integrations with a variety of libraries

## Installation

In order to use this library, we need to add the following line in our `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-config" % "<version>" 
```

# Quick Start

Let's add these four lines to our `build.sbt` file as we are using these modules in our examples:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-config"          % "<version>"
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-config-magnolia" % "<version>"
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-config-typesafe" % "<version>"
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-config-refined"  % "<version>"
```

There are many examples in [here](https://github.com/zio/zio-config/tree/master/examples/shared/src/main/scala/zio/config/examples)
