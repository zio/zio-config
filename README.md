A [zio](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-zio) based  configuration parsing library.

The library aims to have a powerful & purely functional, yet a thin interface to access configuration information inside an application.
Please find more details in the [website](https://zio.github.io/zio-config/).

Jump to [examples](examples/src/main/scala/zio/config/examples) to see various usecases.
Ping in [discord](https://discord.gg/2ccFBr4) zio-config channel for any queries.

Also try out zio-config quickly in [scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/afsalthaj/3ALODWLJQbWmFxqBJ2MYWA/90) which is pre-loaded with an example. We will make sure the scastie-buildsettings are updated with latest version of zio-config, however, we still recommend you keep an eye on it, and change them when needed.
